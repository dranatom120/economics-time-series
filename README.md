# Analysis of Financial Time Series

This project uses time series methods to:

1) Forecast the copper producer price index using [CNN](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/examples/blob/master/courses/udacity_intro_to_tensorflow_for_deep_learning/l08c09_forecasting_with_cnn.ipynb#scrollTo=PgYwn9VM8OJi) and [Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)

2) Analyse the effect of interest rate changes on currency prices using the [CausalImpact](https://github.com/dafiti/causalimpact) package

3) Modelling of currency volatility using GARCH

4) Investigation of cointegration patterns between the copper producer price index and select economic indicators

Data is sourced from Federal Reserve Economic Data using the [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/data/FRED-Federal-Reserve-Economic-Data) API.
